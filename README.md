# Tableau-challenge

Goal of this challenge was to use create a story that highlights two phenomena I discovered after reviewing the NY Citibike logs. I chose two logs to complete my analysis. One for February 2021 and for Febraury 2020. I focused my analysis on usertype data and relationships as well as bike usage.  Further indepth analysis can be found in the citibike analysis rtf.
