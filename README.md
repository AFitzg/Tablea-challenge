# Tableau-challenge

Goal of this challenge was to use Tableau and build visualizations that would lead me to uncover unexpected phenomena using NY Citibike metadata. I created a story that highlights two phenomena I discovered and created visualizations to support it. Analysis can be found in the citibike analysis rtf.
